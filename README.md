# Zaapy
This project was a kind of game created at the end of my second Year of {EPITECH}.

This project is not perfect, there is a segmentation fault on a command of the project (can't remember which one, I think it's 'broadcast').
I call it "a kind of game" because you don't really play, it's an AI who try to survive by collecting stone.

The server was developped in C.
The UI was made thanks to the SFML
The AI doesn't really work, it was made in C++.

I worked on the server and I made the UI in 24 hours.

Bonus : I made a QT-Ruby manager to create a configuration file.
